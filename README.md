- The extension of various function points in the system in plugin, for flexible system expansion, no longer need to use branches to deliver different requirements of the project.
- Various frameworks and their various `spring-boot-xxx-starter` can be integrated in plugin.
- Independent dependencies can now be defined in plugin, not in the main program.
- Can perfectly solve the plugin package and plugin package, plugin package and the main program because of the same framework of different versions of the conflict problem. Individual plugin can define different versions of the framework for the same dependency.
- Without the need to restart the main program, you can freely realize the dynamic installation and deployment of the plugin package, to dynamically expand the function of the system.
- Plugin can also integrate microservice modules independently of the main program.
- And so on, you can imagine what pressing needs and extensions this framework brings to you.
